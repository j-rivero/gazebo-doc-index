#### Preview changes

Before opening a pull request, proposed changes to the documentation index can
be previewed by serving the jekyll project on a local server.

```
cd gazebo-doc-index
jekyll serve
```

For instructions to set up the jekyll project on your machine, refer to the
repository's [README](https://github.com/j-rivero/gazebo-doc-index#getting-started).

####  Test the changes

Automated tests for validating index structure integrity and external links can be run locally by using the following commands - 

```bundle install``` (first time)
```bundle exec rspec --format doc``` (index integrity tests)
```jekyll build && htmlproofer ./_site --url-ignore "/gazebo-doc-index/*/"``` ([html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) tests)

Note: Pull requests can't be merged if they don't pass the automated tests.
