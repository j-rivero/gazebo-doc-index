FEATURES
 * Lightmap : Support lightmap textures for efficient prebaked global illumination, see this example model 3.
 * Particle effects : Full support for particle emitters, which affect sensors like depth cameras and lidars in a realistic way. Try it out with ign gazebo particle_emitter.sdf 2.
 * Heightmaps : Visualize 1 terrains, and soon collide with them too!
 * COLLADA exporter : Generate 2 a COLLADA mesh from a simulation.

 SENSORS
 * Logical audio sensor : New sensor 1 that acts as a microphone to check if audio was detected coming from audio sources in the world.
 * Optical tactile sensor : Sensor 1 that measures contact normals using a depth camera and a contact sensor.

 MOBILE
 Ackermann drive : There’s now an Ackermann steering plugin, try it out with ign gazebo ackermann_steering.sdf 9.
 Mecanum drive : There’s also a Mecanum drive plugin, try it out with ign gazebo mecanum_drive.sdf 17.


"""
Rendering & Sensors : New visual effects and sensor features


GUI : Lots of new GUI features and widgets
    Lights : Insert, configure and visualize lights through the graphical interface or using Ignition Transport.
    Tape measure : Measure distances in the 3D scene by clicking on them.
    Joint controller : A joint position controller widget, try it out with the NAO robot on this world 4.
    Collision visualization : View collision shapes on the graphical interface in order to better introspect running simulations.
    Screenshot : Take screenshots 1 of running simulations and save them to disk with the click of a button.
    Physics parameters : Configure real time factor and step size from the GUI.
